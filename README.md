Distance Based Point CLustering
============


##Mean nearest neighbor distance statistic
First steps:
1. Find out how many points are in the input array
2. Calculate nearest neighbors 
3. Find average of nearest neighbors
4. Generate random points (same total number)
5. Find average nearest neighbor distance
6. Compare averages
